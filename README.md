# MplusCrawler

Crawls raider.io and warcraftlogs webpages to scrap DPS parses from the top 100 players of each class.

Using python 3.9

TODO: Drop the crawler in favor of using the OAuth API for warcraftlogs. The raider.io step is quite fast, so maybe don't need the API for that.

TODO: Organize dps by spec, not by class.
